A chrome extension that allows the user to create aggregate wishlists while shopping on different websites such as Ikea, Amazon, Tentree and more.

Users can also share their wishlists with other users for a collaborative wishlist for organizing gifts or buying supplies for the office.

## Running the projects

You need **TWO** terminals for this.

In one terminal, `cd` into `react-front-end`. Run `npm install`. Then run `npm start` and go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

In the other terminal, `cd` into `rails-back-end`. Run `bundle` to install the dependencies. Run `bin/rake db:setup` to create the databases (called rails_project_development by default). Run `bin/rails s` to run the server.

In the browser, you can click on the button and see the data get loaded.
